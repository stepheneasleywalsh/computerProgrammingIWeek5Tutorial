# A Cubic Solver
## You must write some Python code that does the following:
* The program tells you it can solve a cubic
* It asks for your name
* Next, it asks for the integer coefficients
* Then finally, it tells you the real root with a nice message

# EXAMPLE (What you see)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

I can solve cubics with 3 real roots i.e. ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello Stephen, I will solve ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0.

What is your name? ***stephen***

What is your a? ***1***

What is your b? ***-6***

What is your c? ***11***

What is your d? ***-6***

Hello Stephen, I will solve x^3-6x^2+11x-6=0.

The root of the cubic is 3.0000000000000004

# What's Next?
Now that you have some software to solve cubics
why note test it out on other cubics? It's not perfect
but it is a start!!!
